\section*{Introduction}

The primary objective of this experiment is to...
\n
This pre-lab assignment will act as a guide towards creating a mathematical model before attending lab --  saving critical in-class time for performing experiments and analyzing data. 

\section*{Prerequisites}
Before attempting this pre-lab assignment, it is imperative that you:
{\small
\begin{itemize}
    \item Review \bit{textbook sections 6.3, 7.1 \& 7.4}, including \bit{Example 7.4},
    \item Review \bit{experiment procedures}, and
    \item Watch the \bit{pre-lab videos} on Blackboard (Bb).
\end{itemize}
}


\section*{Getting Started}
First, be sure to download the starter code from Blackboard (Bb), and \textit{extract} (unzip) its contents to the directory in which you wish to complete the exercise\footnote{\textit{Note: When using the Heat Transfer Lab computers, you \ul{must} extract your code to the local hard drive: \texttt{C:/temp/}, NOT to the server (ie., Desktop, Group Folder, \&, etc.)}}. Before attempting, make sure that you have completed all of the \textit{prerequisites} below.

\subsection*{Files included in this exercise:}
Once you have unzipped the contents of the starter package, you should see the following files:

\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand\labelitemi{-- }
   \item \bd{\texttt{ex4.m}}
    \item \texttt{/lib}
\renewcommand\labelitemi{[$\star$]}
    \item \texttt{hilpert.m}
    \item \texttt{zukauskas.m} 
    \item \texttt{churchill\_bernstein.m} 
    \item \texttt{calc\_uncertainty.m} 
\end{itemize}

\noindent
$\star$ indicates files that you will need to complete.

\section{Environment Setup}
Before we can get started, we need to setup our MATLAB environment properly. As always, if using the laboratory computers, be sure to be running your code from the \texttt{C:\textbackslash temp} directory, and also make sure you have unzipped your code properly. Otherwise you may receive `\texttt{./lib not found}' errors.
