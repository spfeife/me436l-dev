\section*{Introduction}

The objective of this experiment is to explore \it{Fourierâ€™s Law} for linear conduction by studying steady-state heat transfer through various materials. Completion of this assignment will provide you with the necessary tools to properly study and explore your collected lab data.

\section*{Prerequisites}
Before attempting this pre-lab assignment, it is imperative that you have:
{\small
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reviewed the \bit{textbook sections:} 2.1, 2.2 \& 3.1-3.1.4,
    \item Reviewed the \bit{experiment procedures}, 
    \item Watched the \bit{pre-lab videos} on Blackboard (Bb), and
    \item Completed the \bit{pre-lab quiz} on Bb.
\end{itemize}
}

\section*{Getting Started}
First, be sure to download the starter code from Blackboard (Bb), and \textit{extract} (unzip) its contents to the directory in which you wish to complete the exercise\footnote{\textit{Note: when using the Heat Transfer Lab computers, you \ul{must} extract your code to the local hard drive: \texttt{C:/temp/}, NOT to the server (ie., Desktop, Group Folder, \&, etc.)}}. Before attempting, make sure that you have completed all of the \textit{prerequisites} below.

\subsection*{Files included in this exercise:}
Once you have unzipped the contents of the starter package, you should see the following files:

\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand\labelitemi{-- }
   \item \texttt{ex1.m}
    \item \texttt{/lib}
   \item \texttt{/data}
\renewcommand\labelitemi{[$\star$]}
    \item \texttt{plotData.m}
    \item \texttt{calc\_ks.m}
    \item \texttt{fouriers\_law.m} 
    \item \texttt{calc\_contact\_res.m} 
\end{itemize}

\noindent
$\star$ indicates files that you will need to complete.\\

\n
Throughout this exercise, you will be using the script \texttt{ex1.m}, but will not be required to make any major modifications to it. You are only required to modify the functions \textit{(often only 1-2 lines of code)} in the files specified above. Your submission will consist of a compilation (via word processor) of \textit{`deliverables'}, specified throughout this document. Instructions for each deliverable will be highlighted in a blue box, similar to the following: 
\setcounter{deliv}{-1}
\begin{formal}
    \begin{deliv} \bit{Sample}s
    
Follow the instructions in this blue box.
    \end{deliv}
\end{formal}

\section{Warm-Up \& System Check}

Before starting, it's often a good idea understand the data by first visualizing it. This section will walk you through the essentials of doing so. \textit{If you have any difficulties getting started, be sure to ask your TA for assistance.} \n

\noindent
First, open the Matlab script \texttt{ex1.m} and read through the instructions. The section immediately following, clears the workspace and initializes our paths and raw data variable. Next, we get to a section titled \textit{`Load Data'}. Here, we load a sample dataset from a text file and store it into the variable \texttt{M}:
\n
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
% load tab separated data
M = load('data.txt'); 
\end{lstlisting}
\n
Now, we have a matrix $M$ of size $93 \times 11$ ($rows \times columns$), or $M \in \mathbb{R}^{93 \times 11}$. The columns in $M$ correspond to:
\\
{\small
\begin{center}\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
\begin{tabular}{|c | c | c | c | c | c | c |}
\hline
\rowcolor{light-gray}
    1 & 2 & 3 & \dots & 9 & 10 & 11 \\ 
    \hline
   \cellcolor{green!10} $time (s)$ & \cellcolor{red!10}$TC_1$ & \cellcolor{red!10}$TC_2$ & \cellcolor{red!10}$\dots$ & \cellcolor{red!10}$TC_8$ & \cellcolor{orange!10}$Voltage, V$ & \cellcolor{orange!10}$Current, A$ \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
}

In which $TC_n$ refers to the thermocouple number, read in degrees Celsius. Next, you will see a line that looks similar to the following:
\n
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
% COMMENT ME OUT!!
break_msg; dbstack; return;
\end{lstlisting}

\n
This is what we refer to as a \texttt{return} command. You will need to \textit{comment out} this line (place a \% out front) in order to continue. 

\n
Next, let's separate out this data into more meaningful variables.\footnote{\textit{Note: if you are not familiar with the syntax, check out: \href{https://www.mathworks.com/company/newsletters/articles/matrix-indexing-in-matlab.html}{Matrix indexing in Matlab}  }} 
\n
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
t = M(:,1);         % get time vector, [s]
dat = M(:,2:9);     % get temps, [C]
V = M(:,10);        % Voltage, [V]
I = M(:,11);        % Current, [A]
\end{lstlisting}

\n
Then we simply plot temperature with time:
\n
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
figure;         % open new figure
h = plot(dat);  % plot the data
set(h, 'LineStyle', '-', 'LineWidth', 2)   % make sure the lines are readable
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

\n
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
% don't forget to add labels!!
xlabel('Time [s]');
ylabel('Temperature [C]');
title('Transient Data, T/C','FontSize',16);
grid on
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

\n
Now, if everything was done correctly, you should get something similar to Fig.~\ref{fig1} below.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=125mm]{gfx/fig1.png}
    \caption{Transient temperature data}\label{fig1}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

A few quick questions to ask:

\begin{formal}
\begin{quest} \bit{Sanity Check.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Does your plot match Fig.~\ref{fig1} above? 
    \item \it{Are you using the correct version of \texttt{MATLAB}?} 
    \item Is all of our data at steady-state?
\end{itemize}
\end{quest}
\end{formal}
\begin{center}
\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced, width=14cm, top=-2mm, colback=red!5, colframe=black!50!white, boxrule=0.25pt, boxsep=2mm]
\n
{\small
\bit{Checkpoint} - If you had any difficulties obtaining Fig.~\ref{fig1}, \bul{stop here} and contact your Lab Instructor. You may run into more troubles ahead.
}
\end{tcolorbox}

\end{center}

When you're ready to continue, comment out the following line:

\n
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
% remove break
break_msg; dbstack; return;
\end{lstlisting}

\n
\hrule

\section{Plot Steady-State Data}

Now, let's plot the spatial temperature distribution. To do this, we simply average the transient data. This is easily done in \texttt{MATLAB} by the $mean( )$ command:

\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
% take an average of the last (~20) points 
N = 20;
Tm = mean(dat(end-N:end,:));      % [C]
Vm = mean(V(end-N:end));          % [V]
Im = mean(I(end-N:end));          % [A]
\end{lstlisting}

Next, we call a \texttt{plotData.m} function to plot our data. As-it-is, this plot function \textit{\ul{is incorrect}} and will not run properly. Therefore, you will need to open \texttt{plotData.m} and adjust code accordingly in order for it to run properly. The sections that you will need to complete are outlined:

\n
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
% plot first three T/Cs
plot(x(2:4),y(1:3),'ko-','MarkerSize', 8);

% plot middle two T/Cs
% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================

% plot last three T/Cs
% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================


% set labels & axis limits
% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
xlabel('');
ylabel('');
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Note: Pay close attention to the instructions.}
\end{itemize}

When you're finished, you must \bit{go back} to \texttt{ex0.m} before you can press \texttt{Run}. If you attempt to run the function \texttt{plotData.m}, you will receive an error. If your adjustments were correct, and \texttt{ex0.m} was properly executed, you should obtain Fig.~\ref{fig2}.



\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=125mm]{gfx/fig2.png}
    \caption{Transient temperature data}\label{fig2}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

Then, if everything was done correctly in part 1a, you should arrive at a figure that resembles Fig.~\ref{fig3} below.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=125mm]{gfx/fig3.png}
    \caption{Steady-state T/C data}\label{fig3}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

Here, we have added regression lines that extend slightly beyond their representative data points --- until they reach a midpoint.  This vertical intersection line dividing the two regression lines, is the \textit{theoretical} point of contact between the two sections. Since we physically can't place a thermocouple at the very edge of each material, these \textit{extrapolated} temperature values are the best we can do. We'll revisit these values when we discuss the contact resistance.

\begin{formal}
    \begin{deliv} \bit{Steady-state T/C plot} (Fig.~\ref{fig3} above) 
    
   Export your figure to an image: \texttt{File >> Export Setup >> Export}, and include it in your submission.
    \end{deliv}
\end{formal}

\section{Calculate Sample Thermal Conductivity, $k_s$}

In this exercise, you will calculate the thermal conductivity, $k_s$, of the unknown specimen. This computation is only made possible by one critical assumption: \it{we can safely assume that a \ul{constant heat flux} passes through the entire linear conduction apparatus.} Let's quickly revisit how this is possible.

\subsection{Background}
Assume that we have a generic plane-wall, like that shown to the right. Recall from your lecture notes and p113 of the textbook, \it{\ul{one form} of the heat equation} may be written as:
\eq{
\frac{d}{dx} \Big( k \frac{dT}{dx} \Big) = 0 \tag{\it{Heat Equation}}
}
\begin{minipage}[c]{0.50\textwidth}
{\small
Rewriting:
\eq{ 
k \frac{d^2 T}{dx^2} = 0
}
Integrating twice, boundary conditions:
\begin{align}
    T(x) &= (T_2 - T_1) \frac{x}{L} + T_1
\end{align}
with slope:
\eq{
dT/dx = \frac{(T_2 - T_1)}{L}
}
}
\end{minipage}  \hfill
\begin{minipage}[c]{0.50\linewidth}
\hspace{0mm}
\vspace{-2ex}
    \includegraphics[width=70mm]{gfx/fig4.png}
\vspace{2pt}
\captionof{figure}{1D Schematic}
\end{minipage}

Plugging into Fourier's Law:

\eq{
q_x &= -k A \frac{dT}{dx} \\
& = \frac{k A}{L} ( T_1 - T_2)
}

Finally, the \it{heat flux} is
\begin{align}
    q_x^{\prime\prime} = \frac{k}{L} (T_1 - T_2)
\end{align}

From Eqns. (1) \& (2) we've shown that the temperature profile is \bit{linear} and the heat flux is \bit{constant}, independent of $x$. 

\n
Now, consider the simple composite wall below. Since the heat flux is constant throughout, we can say:






\begin{minipage}[c]{0.50\textwidth}
{\small
\begin{center}
\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced, width=5cm, top=-4mm, colback=red!5, colframe=black!50!white, boxrule=0.5pt, boxsep=1.5mm, bottom=1mm]
\eq{
q^{\prime\prime}_1 &= q_2^{\prime\prime} \\
- k_1 \Big( \frac{dT}{dx} \Big)_1 &= - k_2 \Big( \frac{dT}{dx} \Big)_2
}
\end{tcolorbox}
\end{center}
}
\end{minipage}  \hfill
\begin{minipage}[c]{0.50\linewidth}
\hspace{-5mm}
\vspace{-2ex}
    \includegraphics[width=80mm]{gfx/fig5.png}\label{fig5}
\vspace{2pt}
\captionof{figure}{Composite wall}
\end{minipage}

Now, using this information, derive an equation for the unknown $k_s$, before moving on to the next section.

\subsection{Implementation}

Next, we'll prepare a \texttt{MATLAB} function to solve for $k_s$. To do this, open the file named \texttt{calc\_ks.m} and insert the $k_s$ equation that you just derived. You will notice that the derivative terms have already been supplied.

\begin{formal}
    \begin{deliv} \bit{(\ $k_s$\ )} 
    If done correctly, your estimated $k_s$ value will be printed to the \texttt{MATLAB} console. Report your results (including units) and provide 1-2 sentences discussing whether your solution is reasonable or not.
    \end{deliv}
\end{formal}


\section{Calculate Heat Rate}

For this exercise, we calculate the heat rate, $q [W]$, for each section of the experiment apparatus. To do so, open up \texttt{fouriers\_law.m} and insert the appropriate form of Fourier's Law:

\eq{
q_x = -k A \frac{dT}{dx}.  \tag{Fourier's Law}
}

Here, we are looking for the \it{heat rate}, not \it{heat flux} - so be careful with units. If your calculations were performed correctly, your \texttt{MATLAB} console should read:

\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
PART 3: Calculate Heat Rate: 

q[W]: 

     Pin      qh       qs       qc  
    _____    _____    _____    _____
    40.74    37.56    37.56    35.66
 
\end{lstlisting}
In which all units are in Watts $[W]$.

\begin{formal}
    \begin{deliv} \bit{Heat Rate:} 
    Paste your \texttt{MATLAB} console output for this section into your report. Provide 1-2 sentences detailing differences and/or potential loss mechanisms between the $P_{in}$ and your calculated values.
    \end{deliv}
\end{formal}


\section{Calculate Contact Resistance}

Open \texttt{calc\_contact\_res.m} and provide the necessary expressions (see text or lecture notes) for the contact resistance. Your values, if correct, should be on the order of $\approx $ \SI{5e-5}{(m^2 C / W)}.
Next, revisit your Fig.~\ref{fig3} produced above. Are these sharp discontinuities between materials realistic? Consider what factors may play a role in creating these `jumps' and what could be used to minimize them.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=125mm]{gfx/fig6.pdf}
    \caption{Transient temperature data}\label{fig6}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
\begin{formal}
    \begin{deliv} \bit{Contact Resistance} 
    Paste your \texttt{MATLAB} console output for this section into your report. Provide 1-2 sentences detailing differences and/or potential loss mechanisms between $P_{in}$ and your calculated values.
    \end{deliv}
\end{formal}
