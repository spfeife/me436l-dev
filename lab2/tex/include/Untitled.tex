\section*{Introduction}
In this exercise, you will implement one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits. Before starting the programming exercise, we strongly recommend watching the video lectures and completing the review questions for the associated topics.To get started with the exercise, you will need to download the starter code and unzip its contents to the directory where you wish to complete the exercise. If needed, use the cd command in Octave/MATLAB to change to this directory before starting this exercise.You can also find instructions for installing Octave/MATLAB in the “Environment Setup Instructions” of the course website.
